          I’m Harshil Bhatia, a high school student passionate about pursuing fine arts as a professional
          career. My work explores themes of identity and emotion through portraiture and expressionism,
          often inspired by personal experiences and inner fears. I enjoy experimenting with composition,
          texture, and color to find my own visual language. I mainly work with oil paints, while charcoal
          and pastels also play a key role in my practice. As a growing artist, I’m constantly learning and
          evolving, with the aim of contributing significantly to Indian contemporary art.
